     -- The field we will first work with is GF(8) ~ Z2/(x^3 + x + 1) = {0,1,x,x^2,x+1,x^2+1,x^2+x,x^2+x+1}
     -- In binary, these elements can be represented as {000,001,010,100,011,101,110,111}, which in turn can be
     -- represented as {0,1,2,4,3,5,6,7}.  This is a field because the polynomial is reducible.  Moreover, the 
     -- non-zero elements form a multiplicative cyclic group.  If we can find a generator, then we can perform multiplication
     -- via discrete logarithms.  The multiplicative subgroup has order 7 and therefore by Lagrange's theorem, every
     -- non-trivial element generates the entire group
